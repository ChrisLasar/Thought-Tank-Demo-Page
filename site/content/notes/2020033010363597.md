A note should be assigned to exactly one topic.

Examples of topics in this system are:

* Zettelkasten: for general thoughts on creating and managing a Zettelkasten
* Thought Tank: thoughts on the implementation of the Zettelkasten in the Thought Tank tool

A slip box has only a few, large topics. With a [#](/notes/2020033010525847 "Tag") you can further structure the Zettelkasten.
