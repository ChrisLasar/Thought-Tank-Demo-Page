While working with ThoughtTank, ideas are created by linking to ideas already
captured. New ideas, on the other hand, are usually created outside the system
when working with other systems. These systems often provide much better
mechanisms for capturing ideas.  The user should collect them there regularly
and integrate them into his or her Zettelkasten.

Examples:

* Storage for newspaper clippings with markers

* Notebook (physical or virtual)

* Dictation function in the smartphone

* Pocket for filing and marking on websites
