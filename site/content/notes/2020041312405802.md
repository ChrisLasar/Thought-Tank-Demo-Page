title: Full capture of all floating notes
topics: Thought Tank
summary: >-
  While working with ThoughtTank, ideas are created by linking to ideas already
  captured. New ideas, on the other hand, are usually created outside the system
  when working with other systems. These systems often provide much better
  mechanisms for capturing ideas.  The user should collect them there regularly
  and integrate them into his or her Zettelkasten.


  Examples:

  * Storage for newspaper clippings with markers

  * Notebook (physical or virtual)

  * Dictation function in the smartphone

  * Pocket for filing and marking on websites

In ThoughtTank, inbox sources give users an overview of places where they might have collected new ideas in the past. They should integrate these into their Zettelkasten.
