These are the ways of connecting/linking note:

* The **suggested way of linking** is using id and title as a link `[#](2020032817270190-if-connections-between-notes-are-central-to-a-zettelkasten-creating-links-should-be-as-convinient-as-possible)`: [#](2020032817270190-if-connections-between-notes-are-central-to-a-zettelkasten-creating-links-should-be-as-convinient-as-possible)

  * ThoughtTank just uses the id for lookup, so if a title changes later, the link won't break.
  * The text is still readable during editing.
  * You can judge, if you choosed a good title for your link target and maybe improve it. 

* The **shortest way of linking** is using an hash symbol `#` as text and the notes id as the link. The hash is replaced by the nodes title, e.g. `[#](2020032817270190)`: [#](2020032817270190)

  * other markdown editors show at least a hash which is connected to the other note
  * All variants without URL show note title as link text

    * e.g.  `[#](/notes/2020032817270190)`: [#](/notes/2020032817270190)

* Note ID as text without URL `[2020032817270190]()` is another short form which shows the id that links to nowhere in other markdown editors: [2020032817270190](<>)
* If you do note want to show the notes title, you can set a different text

  * `[link with just a number](2020032817270190)`: [link with just a number](2020032817270190)
  * `[link with short URL](/notes/2020032817270190)`: [link with short URL](/notes/2020032817270190)
  * `[link with extended URL](/notes/2020032817270190-linking-notes-in-thought-tank/)`: [link with extended URL](/notes/2020032817270190-linking-notes-in-thought-tank/)

    * we just use the number to discover the note's page, so if you change the title and therefore the permanent link, we do not care
    * a link always uses the up-to-date extended permanent link as its target URL
  * `[all variants also w/o leading slash](notes/2020032817270190)`: [all variants also w/o leading slash](notes/2020032817270190)
* If you just want to see the unique ID, use it as the text and URL, e.g. `[2020032817270190](2020032817270190)`: [2020032817270190](2020032817270190)

Other links are not changed

* links to other pages, `[example]](/)`: [example](/)
* links to relative subpages, `[example]](subpage)`: [example](subpage)

  * link to missing ids, are assumed to be a subpage `[example](4711081547110815)`: [example](4711081547110815)
* links to other hosts, `[example]](http://www.foo.bar/notes/2020032817270190)`: [example](http://www.foo.bar/notes/2020032817270190)

Links that do not work properly

* Links without text `[](2020032817270190)` are not even detected as links: [](2020032817270190)
* Wiki links `[[2020032817270190]]` do not work: \[[2020032817270190]]
