In most representations of a note, we do not show the flow tags. We use them when selecting the notes to be displayed.

**Examples:**

* In the inbox, we show you the notes with the flow tag `inbox`.
* We help you to improve your note collection and check the notes for different characteristics. So the summary should be as short as possible. If you no longer want us to warn you that a note has a very long summary, then set the flow tag `accept-summary`.
