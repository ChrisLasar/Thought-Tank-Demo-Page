A prototypical read workflow with ThoughtTank can look like this:

- Create or mark important passages while reading the literature notes (This is typically done outside of ThoughtTank. ThoughtTank uses the concept of the inbox to support those collecting the literature notes).
- Transfer the most important ideas from the literature notes to the permanent notes in the inbox
- Assign to a topic
- Define keywords
-Link the permanent note (possibly the keywords already lead to related notes - implicit links, which can now be linked explicitly).
- Do not forget the other direction: Which notes should link the new note?
Set tags

**Checklist**

- Ensure that the note is accessible in a few steps from an entry point.
