To support [#](/notes/2020041509534662 "Applications in which the Zettelkasten is superior to other approaches") we added the following feature during for the different phases of your thoughts lifecycle:

- Collecting notes
  - Different inboxes allow you to [#](/notes/2020041312405802 "Capture your thoughts whereever you are").
- Writing an presenting notes
  - Thought Tank uses a [#](/notes/2020041509262035 "Predefined structure for capturing a thought "), this also allows for adequate presentation in different situations and
  - also allows you to [#](/notes/2020041319033216 "Quickly get to the core of a thought").
- Connecting notes
  - [#](/notes/2020032817270190 "As connections between notes create most value, connecting should be as convenient as possible")
  - [#](/notes/2020041312255463 "Transformation of implicit into explicit relationships between notes generate knowledge") therefore we are [#](/notes/2020033010475958 "Supporting the identification of related thoughts")
- Improving notes
  - [#](/notes/2020041312361032 "More efficiency and productivity through process support")
  - Foster a flow with respect to editing, as [#](/notes/2020033010573035 "Continuous curration of notes increases the quality of the Zettelkasten"). So you can think of it as a [#](/notes/2020041410531784 "Process support in place of self-discipline") ;).

While tha above has been Thought Tankâ€˜s support on the [#](/notes/2020041409034716 "Route of information from the text read into the zettelkasten"), you also want to find your notes later.

- Finding notes
  - [#](/notes/2020033010363597 "Separation of independent logical units") using topics and orthogonal structuring with [#](/notes/2020033010525847 "Tag")
  - While a single thought should be atomic to ensure the [#](/notes/2020041312062417 "Unambiguousness of links"), you can have entry/index points for [#](/notes/2020041408555708 "Documentation of larger, coherent thoughts: the entrypoints"). This note is an entrypoint too.
