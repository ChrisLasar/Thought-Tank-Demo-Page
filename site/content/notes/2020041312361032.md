title: More efficiency and productivity through process support
topics: Thought Tank
summary: >-
  The flow is a mental state of complete immersion and complete absorption in an
  activity. ThinkTank wants to establish this state in the user with regard to
  the development and curation of their Zettelkasten.


  Examples:


  * The inbox lists notes that need revision and integration into their Zettelkasten. It also lists your inbox sources, behind which other notes can be hidden.


  * We also list titles and summaries that are too long, as we believe that they disturb your reading flow. Try to make them more compact.
