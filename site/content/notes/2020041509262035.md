A completely described thought consists of 

- the explanation of its relevance (Why? So What?), 

- the presentation of the consequence (What?) for the reader, the author or another object and 

- if necessary, an argumentation which derives this consequence. (How?)

In the case of listing connected notes, you may only want to display the relevance of the connected note or the context in which it is relevant. 
In a short description of the connected thoughts, the consequence of this thought is also of interest. In a presentation or documentation, one would also like to deduce this thought for the reader.
