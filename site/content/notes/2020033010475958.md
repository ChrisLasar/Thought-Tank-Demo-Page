The set of keywords in a note together with a [#](2020033010363597) span a context in which we look for related notes that put themselves into the same context. By sharing a context notes are in an implicit relationship with each other. This allows the user for [#](notes/2020041312255463/knowledge-generation-by-transforming-implicit-into-explicit-relationships/) in the next step.

The choice of keywords can be guided by the question: In what context do I want to have this note suggested again?

**Tip:** Use the singular. Make sure not to use different synonyms for the same context.
