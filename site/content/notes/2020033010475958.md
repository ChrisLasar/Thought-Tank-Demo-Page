The set of keywords in a note together with a [#](/notes/2020033010363597 "Separation of independent logical units") span a context in which we look for related notes that put themselves into the same context. By sharing a context notes are in an implicit relationship with each other. This allows the user for [#](/notes/2020041312255463 "Transformation of implicit into explicit relationships between notes generate knowledge") in the next step.

The choice of keywords can be guided by the question: In what context do I want to have this note suggested again?

**Tip:** Use the singular. Make sure not to use different synonyms for the same context.
